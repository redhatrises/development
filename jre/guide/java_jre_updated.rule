    If the system is joined to the Red Hat Network, a Red Hat Satellite Server,
    or a yum server, run the following command to install updates:
    code="$ sudo yum update"
    If the system is not configured to use one of these sources, updates (in the form of RPM packages)
    can be manually downloaded and installed using config_item="rpm".

ocil:
    clause: it is not updated
    description: |
        If the system is joined to the Red Hat Network, a Red Hat Satellite Server, or
        a yum server which provides updates, invoking the following command will
        indicate if updates are available:
        code="$ sudo yum check-update"
        If the system is not configured to update from one of these sources,
        run the following command to list when each package was last updated:
        code="$ rpm -qa -last"
        Compare this to Red Hat Security Advisories (RHSA) listed at
        <weblink-macro link="https://access.redhat.com/security/updates/active/" />
        to determine if the system is missing applicable updates.

rationale: |    
    Running an older version of the JRE can introduce security
    vulnerabilities to the system.
