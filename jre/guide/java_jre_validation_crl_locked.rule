title: Disable User Access to Revocation Check Settings
rule_id: java_jre_validation_crl_locked
primary_group: java
severity: medium

description: |
    To ensure that users cannot change certificate revocation check settings,
    add config_item="deployment.security.validation.crl.locked" to
    config_item="/etc/.java/deployment/deployment.properties".

ocil:
    clause: it does not exist or is not configured properly
    description: |
        To verify that users cannot change revocation check settings,
        run the following command:
        code="$ grep 'validation.crl.locked' /etc/.java/deployment/deployment.properties"
        If properly configured, the output should return:
        code="deployment.security.validation.crl.locked"

rationale: |    
    Permitting execution of an applet published with a revoked certificate may
    result in spoofing, malware, system modification, invasion of privacy,
    and denial of service. As such, ensuring users cannot change settings
    contributes to a more consistent security profile.
