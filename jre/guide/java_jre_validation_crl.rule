title: Enable Revocation Checks for Publisher Certificates
rule_id: java_jre_validation_crl
primary_group: java
severity: medium

description: |
    To ensure that certificate revocation checks are enabled, set
    <tt>deployment.security.validation.crl</tt> to equal <tt>true</tt>
    in <tt>/etc/.java/deployment/deployment.properties</tt>.

ocil:
    clause: it does not exist or is not configured properly
    description: |
        To verify that revocation checks are enabled, run the following command:
        <pre>$ grep 'validation.crl=true' /etc/.java/deployment/deployment.properties</pre>
        If properly configured, the output should return:
        <pre>deployment.security.validation.crl=true</pre>

rationale: |    
    Certificates may be revoked due to improper issuance, compromise of the certificate,
    and failure to adhere to policy. Therefore, any certificate found on a CRL
    should not be trusted. Permitting execution of an applet published with a
    revoked certificate may result in spoofing, malware, system modification,
    invasion of privacy, and denial of service.
