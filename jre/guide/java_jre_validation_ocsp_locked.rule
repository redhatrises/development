title: Disable User Access to Online Certificate Validation Settings
rule_id: java_jre_validation_ocsp_locked
primary_group: java
severity: medium

description: |
    To ensure that users cannot change the online certificate verification settings,
    add <tt>deployment.security.validation.ocsp.locked</tt> to
    <tt>/etc/.java/deployment/deployment.properties</tt>.

ocil:
    clause: it does not exist or is not configured properly
    description: |
        To verify that users cannot change online certificate verification,
        run the following command:
        <pre>$ grep 'validation.ocsp.locked' /etc/.java/deployment/deployment.properties</pre>
        If properly configured, the output should return:
        <pre>deployment.security.validation.ocsp.locked</pre>

rationale: |    
    Online certificate validation provides a greater degree of validation of certificates
    when running a signed Java applet. Permitting execution of an applet with an invalid
    certificate may result in malware execution , system modification, invasion of privacy,
    and denial of service. As such, ensuring users cannot change settings contributes to
    a more consistent security profile.
