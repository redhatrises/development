title: The Java Configuration File Exists
rule_id: java_jre_deployment_config_exists
primary_group: java_jre_deployment_config_configured
severity: medium

description: |
    If the Java configuration file does not exist, it can be added by running:
    code="$ sudo mkdir -p -m 755 /etc/.java/deployment
    $ sudo touch /etc/.java/deployment/deployment.config
    $ sudo chmod 644 /etc/.java/deployment/deployment.config"

ocil:
    clause: it does not exist
    description: |
        "To verify that the {'tt': 'deployment.config'} file exists,
        run the following command:
        {'pre', '$ ls /etc/.java/deployment'}
        The output should contain:
        code="deployment.config""

rationale: |
    The deployment.config file is used for specifying the location and
    execution of system-level properties for the Java Runtime Environment. By
    default no deployment.config file exists; thus, no system-wide
    deployment.properties file exists. Without the deployment.config file,
    setting particular options for the Java control panel is impossible.
