title: Enable Online Certificate Validation
rule_id: java_jre_validation_ocsp
primary_group: java
severity: medium

description: |
    To ensure that online certificate verification is enabled, set
    config_item="deployment.security.validation.ocsp" to equal config_value="true"
    in config_item="/etc/.java/deployment/deployment.properties".

ocil:
    clause: it does not exist or is not configured properly
    description: |
        To verify that online certificate verification is enabled,
        run the following command:
        code="$ grep 'validation.ocsp=true' /etc/.java/deployment/deployment.properties"
        If properly configured, the output should return:
        code="deployment.security.validation.ocsp=true"

rationale: |    
    Online certificate validation provides a greater degree of validation of certificates
    when running a signed Java applet. Permitting execution of an applet with an invalid
    certificate may result in malware execution , system modification, invasion of privacy,
    and denial of service.
